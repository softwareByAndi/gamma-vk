forgot to have the AI log the session notes, so this will be concise:

I basically had to delete all existing tests in the code base and start over because they were written to not fail instead of defining the expected behavior

# Session Log: Context Testing
Date: 2025-06-25
TL;DR: Implemented test-driven development (TDD) workflows and initial tests for `VulkanContext` in Rust, focusing on expected behavior and comprehensive coverage.

- created `docs/TESTING_PATTERNS.md` to document testing patterns
- created two new workflows:
    - `.claude/commands/test_cases.md` - for generating test cases
    - `.claude/commands/test_validate.md` - for validating existing tests (still needs some work)
- created suite of planned test cases in `tests/context.tests.md`
- implemented initial tests in `tests/context.rs` based on the planned cases
- updated `src/context.rs` 
    - added device logic
    - added queue logic - `VulkanContext::graphics_queue()`
    - added builder pattern - `VulkanContext::builder()` - `VulkanContextBuilder`
- still need to implement:
    - validation layers
    - --device selection algorithm-- (DEFERRED)
    - error handling improvements
- added `tests/context.summary.md` to summarize implemented tests
- added `plans/context_plans.md` to outline future work to `VulkanContext`
