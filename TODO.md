# Gamma-VK Development TODO

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress of Gamma-VK using iterative development principles. Each iteration focuses on delivering working, tested functionality while building toward a complete graphics engine.

## Current Status
- **Project Phase**: Foundation/Setup
- **Current Iteration**: Pre-Development (Documentation and Planning)
- **Next Iteration**: Make it a Library (Iteration 1)

## Iteration Strategy
Based on staff engineer reviews, the approach focuses on **working software over perfect process**. Priorities:
- ‚úÖ Local development with real Vulkan (no mocking)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive unit tests run locally
- ‚è∏Ô∏è CI/CD deferred until complexity is justified
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Cross-platform testing deferred (design for it, test when hardware available)
- üîÑ Error handling improved iteratively, not built perfect upfront

## Getting Started (Your First Day)
1. **Verify baseline**: Run `cargo run` - confirm Hello World works on your system
2. **Start development**: Begin Iteration 1, Day 1, first task
3. **Create branch**: `git checkout -b iteration-1-library`
4. **Begin with**: Configure Cargo.toml with basic dev-dependencies

## Iteration Planning

## Development Guidelines

### Daily Workflow
1. **Check TODO.md** for current iteration tasks
2. **Update task status** as work progresses
3. **Run tests** before committing changes
4. **Update documentation** for new features
5. **Review code quality** with clippy and fmt

### Task Status Legend
- üìã **BACKLOG**: Not yet started, planned for future
- üîÑ **PLANNED**: Defined and ready to start
- üöß **IN PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- üîç **REVIEW**: Completed, awaiting review/testing
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Finished and verified
- ‚ùå **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- üîÑ **DEFERRED**: Moved to later iteration

### Quality Standards
- All public APIs must have rustdoc documentation
- Unit tests required for all non-trivial functionality
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- No clippy warnings in default configuration
- Code formatted with rustfmt
- Memory safety verified (no unsafe without justification)

### Daily Workflow (Local Development)
1. **Morning standup** (self): Review yesterday's progress, plan today's tasks
2. **Quality check**: Run `cargo test && cargo clippy && cargo fmt` before starting
3. **Work in small increments**: Commit working code frequently
4. **End-of-day validation**: Ensure all quality gates still pass
5. **Update TODO.md**: Mark completed tasks, note any blockers or changes

### Risk Management (Simplified)
- **Technical Risks**: Document unknowns and research solutions (spikes if needed)
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to iteration goals; defer nice-to-haves to future iterations
- **Quality Debt**: Address failing tests and clippy warnings immediately
- **Complexity Creep**: Keep solutions simple; optimize and abstract later
- **Vulkan Compatibility**: Design for cross-platform, test locally first

### Dependency Management
Simple linear progression:
- **Iteration 1 ‚Üí 2**: Library must exist before building rendering on top
- **Iteration 2 ‚Üí 3**: Basic rendering must work before adding textures/error improvements
- **Each day**: Previous day's work must be complete and tested

### Rollback Strategy
If any iteration becomes blocked:
1. **Assess scope**: Can it be reduced to meet timeline?
2. **Defer complexity**: Move advanced features to future iterations
3. **Maintain working state**: Always keep examples functional
4. **Document lessons**: Update TODO.md with findings for future reference

## Notes and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **RAII Pattern**: All resources use automatic lifetime management
- **Type Safety**: Distinct types for different resource usages
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with recovery strategies
- **Modularity**: Functional organization, clear public interfaces

### Technical Notes
- MoltenVK requires `khr_portability_enumeration` extension
- Current setup successfully initializes Vulkan on macOS
- Using Vulkano 0.35.1 for Vulkan abstraction
- Winit 0.30 for window management

### Future Considerations (Post-Iteration 3)
- Async resource loading for large assets
- Multi-threaded command recording
- Plugin system for custom rendering techniques
- Integration with popular game engines
- Advanced rendering techniques (PBR, shadows, post-processing)
- Scene graph and spatial optimization

## Iteration Health Tracking

### Current Iteration Metrics
- **Velocity**: Track story points completed per iteration
- **Quality**: Monitor test coverage, clippy warnings, performance regressions
- **Predictability**: Measure estimation accuracy (planned vs actual duration)
- **Risk**: Count blockers encountered and resolution time

### Weekly Checkpoints
Every iteration should have mid-week health checks:
1. **Progress Assessment**: Are we on track for iteration goals?
2. **Blocker Review**: What's blocking progress and how to resolve?
3. **Quality Check**: Are quality gates being maintained?
4. **Scope Assessment**: Do we need to adjust Must Have vs Should Have?

### Staff Engineer Review Notes
- **First Review**: Original Iteration 1 was too ambitious (6 weeks planned for 2 weeks)
- **Second Review**: Removed unnecessary complexity (CI/CD, mocking, cross-platform)
- **Final Approach**: Focus on working software over perfect process
- **Key Deferrals**: CI/CD, cross-platform testing, advanced error handling, complex infrastructure
- **Pragmatic Priorities**: Local development, real Vulkan testing, iterative improvements

### Design Philosophy
- **Start Simple**: Basic library first, optimize later
- **Real Testing**: Use actual Vulkan instead of mocking
- **Local First**: Perfect local development before adding complexity
- **Iterative Error Handling**: Improve error handling incrementally, not upfront
- **Justify Complexity**: Only add infrastructure when benefits are clear
