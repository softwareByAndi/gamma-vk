## Development Guidelines

### Daily Workflow
1. **Check TODO.md** for current iteration tasks
2. **Update task status** as work progresses
3. **Run tests** before committing changes
4. **Update documentation** for new features
5. **Review code quality** with clippy and fmt

### Task Status Legend
- üìã **BACKLOG**: Not yet started, planned for future
- üîÑ **PLANNED**: Defined and ready to start
- üöß **IN PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- üîç **REVIEW**: Completed, awaiting review/testing
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Finished and verified
- ‚ùå **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- üîÑ **DEFERRED**: Moved to later iteration

### Quality Standards
- All public APIs must have rustdoc documentation
- Unit tests required for all non-trivial functionality
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- No clippy warnings in default configuration
- Code formatted with rustfmt
- Memory safety verified (no unsafe without justification)

### Risk Management
- **Technical Risks**: Document unknowns and spike solutions
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to iteration goals, defer nice-to-haves
- **Quality Debt**: Address failing tests and clippy warnings immediately
- **Performance**: Establish baselines early, monitor regressions

## Notes and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **RAII Pattern**: All resources use automatic lifetime management
- **Type Safety**: Distinct types for different resource usages
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with recovery strategies
- **Modularity**: Functional organization, clear public interfaces

### Technical Notes
- MoltenVK requires `khr_portability_enumeration` extension
- Current setup successfully initializes Vulkan on macOS
- Using Vulkano 0.35.1 for Vulkan abstraction
- Winit 0.30 for window management

### Future Considerations
- Async resource loading for large assets
- Multi-threaded command recording
- Plugin system for custom rendering techniques
- Integration with popular game engines
