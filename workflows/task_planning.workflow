# Task Planning Workflow

## Objective
Break down complex development tasks into manageable, well-defined work items with clear success criteria and realistic time estimates.

## Procedure

### 1. Task Analysis
- [ ] **Requirements Understanding** - Clearly define what needs to be accomplished
- [ ] **Complexity Assessment** - Evaluate technical complexity and unknowns
- [ ] **Dependency Mapping** - Identify dependencies on other tasks or external factors
- [ ] **Risk Identification** - Spot potential complications or blockers

### 2. Decomposition Strategy
- [ ] **Logical Breakdown** - Split task into logical, sequential subtasks
- [ ] **Size Validation** - Ensure each subtask is completable in reasonable timeframe
- [ ] **Interface Definition** - Define clear inputs/outputs for each subtask
- [ ] **Testing Strategy** - Plan how each subtask will be validated

### 3. Implementation Planning
- [ ] **Architecture Review** - Ensure approach aligns with design principles
- [ ] **API Design** - Sketch public interfaces before implementation
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Plan error cases and recovery strategies
- [ ] **Performance Considerations** - Identify performance-critical aspects

### 4. Success Criteria Definition
- [ ] **Measurable Outcomes** - Define clear, testable success criteria
- [ ] **Quality Standards** - Specify quality requirements (tests, docs, etc.)
- [ ] **Integration Points** - Plan how work integrates with existing system
- [ ] **Example Usage** - Define how the feature will be demonstrated

### 5. Estimation and Scheduling
- [ ] **Time Estimation** - Provide realistic time estimates for each subtask
- [ ] **Buffer Planning** - Include appropriate buffer for unknowns
- [ ] **Milestone Definition** - Set interim checkpoints for progress tracking
- [ ] **Priority Ordering** - Sequence tasks by priority and dependencies

## Decision Points
- [ ] **Is this task too large?** - Consider if further breakdown is needed
- [ ] **Are dependencies clear?** - Ensure all prerequisites are identified
- [ ] **Is the approach sound?** - Validate architectural decisions early
- [ ] **Are success criteria measurable?** - Confirm objective completion criteria

## Expected Outcomes
- Well-defined subtasks with clear boundaries
- Realistic timeline with appropriate buffers
- Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- Clear success criteria for each work item

## Time Estimate
15-30 minutes (varies by task complexity)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task broken into manageable subtasks
- [ ] Each subtask has clear success criteria
- [ ] Dependencies and risks identified
- [ ] Realistic timeline established
