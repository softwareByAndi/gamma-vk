# Iteration Review Workflow

## Objective
Conduct comprehensive iteration health check to assess progress, identify risks, and ensure quality standards are maintained throughout development cycles.

## Procedure

### 1. Progress Assessment
- [ ] **Task Completion Analysis** - Review completed vs planned tasks in current iteration
- [ ] **Velocity Tracking** - Compare current pace against iteration timeline
- [ ] **Quality Metrics** - Check test coverage, clippy warnings, performance regressions
- [ ] **Deliverable Status** - Assess if iteration goals will be met on schedule

### 2. Risk Evaluation
- [ ] **Blocker Identification** - Document any current or potential blockers
- [ ] **Technical Debt Review** - Assess accumulated technical debt impact
- [ ] **Scope Creep Check** - Identify any unplanned work that's been added
- [ ] **Resource Constraints** - Evaluate if current resources are sufficient

### 3. Quality Assessment
- [ ] **Code Quality Review** - Run full quality suite (test, clippy, fmt)
- [ ] **Architecture Alignment** - Verify implementation matches design principles
- [ ] **Documentation Currency** - Check if docs reflect current implementation
- [ ] **Example Functionality** - Verify all examples still work correctly

### 4. Schedule Analysis
- [ ] **Timeline Reality Check** - Assess if remaining work fits in iteration timeframe
- [ ] **Priority Adjustment** - Identify tasks that might need to move to future iterations
- [ ] **Must-Have vs Should-Have** - Re-evaluate task priorities based on current progress
- [ ] **Buffer Time Assessment** - Check if adequate buffer exists for unexpected issues

### 5. Decision Making
- [ ] **Scope Adjustment Needed?** - Determine if iteration scope needs modification
- [ ] **Quality Gate Status** - Confirm all quality standards are being met
- [ ] **Process Improvements** - Identify workflow optimizations for future iterations
- [ ] **Next Iteration Planning** - Begin high-level planning for subsequent iteration

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear picture of iteration health and trajectory
- Identified risks with mitigation strategies
- Adjusted priorities and scope if needed
- Documented lessons learned

## Time Estimate
10-15 minutes (typically done mid-iteration)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive assessment completed
- [ ] Critical issues identified and addressed
- [ ] Realistic plan for iteration completion
- [ ] Quality standards maintained
