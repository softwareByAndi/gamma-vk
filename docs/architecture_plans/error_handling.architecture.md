# Error Handling Architecture Plan

## Overview
This plan enhances Gamma-VK's error handling to provide richer context, better recovery strategies, and more sophisticated error categorization while maintaining the existing simple API. The goal is to make errors more actionable and debuggable without adding complexity to the user experience.

## Behavior Specification

### Expected Behaviors (Test-First)
1. **Error Context Preservation**: Errors carry sufficient context to debug issues
   - Test: `test_error_context_includes_operation_details`
   - Edge case: Nested errors maintain full call chain

2. **Error Recovery Hints**: Errors suggest recovery actions when possible
   - Test: `test_error_provides_recovery_suggestions`
   - Recovery: Users get actionable advice for common failures

3. **Error Categorization**: Errors are classified by severity and recoverability
   - Test: `test_error_severity_classification_correct`
   - Edge case: Same underlying error has different severity in different contexts

4. **Platform-Specific Error Handling**: Platform differences are abstracted
   - Test: `test_platform_errors_normalized_across_systems`
   - Recovery: Fallback strategies for platform limitations

5. **Error Aggregation**: Multiple related errors can be collected
   - Test: `test_error_collection_preserves_all_failures`
   - Edge case: Performance impact of collecting many errors

### Public API Design
```rust
// Enhanced error type with richer context
pub struct GammaVkError {
    kind: ErrorKind,
    context: ErrorContext,
    source: Option<Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>>,
    recovery_hint: Option<String>,
}

// Error severity levels
pub enum ErrorSeverity {
    Fatal,      // Unrecoverable, requires restart
    Critical,   // Current operation fails, but system continues
    Warning,    // Degraded functionality, but operation succeeds
}

// Error recovery strategies
pub trait ErrorRecovery {
    fn suggest_recovery(&self) -> Option<RecoveryStrategy>;
    fn can_retry(&self) -> bool;
    fn severity(&self) -> ErrorSeverity;
}

// Context builder for rich error information
pub struct ErrorContext {
    operation: String,
    resource_type: Option<String>,
    details: HashMap<String, String>,
}

// Result type with error context builder
pub trait ResultExt<T> {
    fn context<C: Into<String>>(self, context: C) -> Result<T>;
    fn with_recovery_hint<H: Into<String>>(self, hint: H) -> Result<T>;
}
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Key Thought
The most effective starting point is to write one specific test that demonstrates the simplest 
useful behavior of what you're building. This follows the project's core principle: "The test
defines the specification."

Why This Works:
1. Forces Clarity: You can't write a test without knowing exactly what you want
2. Prevents Over-Engineering: You only build what's needed to pass the test
3. Provides Immediate Feedback: You know when you're done
4. Natural Evolution: Each test reveals the next needed piece

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Analysis
1. **Direct Dependencies**:
   - Uses: std::error::Error, thiserror crate
   - Used By: All modules (context, buffer, shader, future modules)
   
2. **Indirect Interactions**:
   - Shared Resources: Error messages, debug output
   - Event Flow: Errors propagate up call stack
   - State Changes: Some errors trigger cleanup

### Platform Notes
- macOS/MoltenVK: Normalize portability extension errors
- Cross-platform: Ensure consistent error messages across platforms
- CI Environment: Handle missing Vulkan gracefully

### Architecture Decision Records
1. **Keep Single Error Type**: GammaVkError remains the only public error type
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Module-specific error types
   - **Rationale**: Simpler API, easier error handling for users
   - **Trade-offs**: Less type safety, but more ergonomic

2. **Context Over Inheritance**: Use composition for error context
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Error type hierarchy
   - **Rationale**: More flexible, avoids complex type hierarchies
   - **Trade-offs**: Slightly more verbose, but clearer

3. **Opt-in Enhancements**: New features don't break existing code
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Breaking change for better API
   - **Rationale**: Maintain stability while adding features
   - **Trade-offs**: Some API duplication during transition

### Risk Assessment
- **Main Risk**: Over-engineering error handling
  - **Mitigation**: Start simple, add features based on actual needs
  - **Early Warning Signs**: Complex error creation code, user confusion

- **Performance Risk**: Error context collection overhead
  - **Mitigation**: Lazy evaluation, compile-time optimizations
  - **Early Warning Signs**: Benchmarks show error path slowdown

- **Compatibility Risk**: Breaking existing error handling code
  - **Mitigation**: Careful API design, extensive testing
  - **Early Warning Signs**: Existing tests fail
